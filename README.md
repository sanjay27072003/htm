## Inspiration💡
Many people are not going to the hospital because it is costly, and if they diagnose with nothing, they think their money Will be wasted. Once We have seen a chatbot on a website, we can chat with it while waiting for our turn. Furthermore, We enjoyed chatting with it. So We thought to develop a bot that helps the user by giving some advice or statements that helps them to stay healthy.
## What it does 🩺🚩
It is a chatbot that needed to be added to discord and then gives tips, suggestions, and more
!h => Gives random health tip
!tts => Reads out the voice message
!cancer => Gives some information about cancer
!keyword => Gives information that is related to a keyword. We stored some keywords in the list
!poll => Chooses random option from the list user given, and then it reacts to message
! => If messages start with this, the bot will understand you need it and then gives generated text related, applies when its keyword is not in it

The bot uses Cohere API to generate these things.

## How we built it🧱⚙️
We used Python language to code our bot.
We used Cohere API to generate the texts that are being given by the bot
We used discord.py to make our bot
We used GTTS for text-to-speech command
We tried using Coil for web monetizing our project to get support and funds.

## Challenges we ran into🧗✨
The smallest one is: The bot is looped to its own message, and we solved it immediately
Learning how to use cohere properly became a bit hard, but later we found it fun and easy
using discord.py, we had to check many sources to get functions that are available in it, its time consuming but not complicated
we tried four different tts libraries, and we messed up and later got the best tts library that works for us
We tried using Coil for web monetization, but for getting a pointer from uphold, we faced issues with our account, and it is locked; we contacted support, but the problem was not solved


## Accomplishments that we are proud of🏆✨
Built our first discord bot
finally used **cohere** for a good cause
explored how to use files in python
making a bot that helps every person regardless of age and other factors


## What we learned🏫✨
We learned to build a discord bot, how NLP with cohere works, and Some medical and health facts.
We enjoyed working with this.

## What is next for MODOK🔮🤖
We are looking to introduce a few more commands to it
and thinking to make it anonymous chat with a ticket, so not everyone who responds will know who asked, which helps the user if they are suffering from mental health and want to hide.
